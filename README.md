# protostar-exploits
My exploits and journey to learning buffer and stack overflows using protostar image

## What is it?
Check it out on - http://exploit-exercises.lains.space/protostar/

## How can you run these exploits?

copy all python code into `/tmp/stack#.py`

Some of the code expects an input as argument, and some expects user input. 

0. stack0:
`python /tmp/stack0.py | ./stack0`

1. stack1:
`./stack1` ``python /tmp/stack1.py``

2. stack2:
export GREENIE=`python /tmp/stack2.py`

3. stack3:
`python /tmp/stack3.py | ./stack3`

4. stack4:
`python /tmp/stack4.py | ./stack4`

5. stack5:


6. stack6:


7. stack7:


## Dependencies
